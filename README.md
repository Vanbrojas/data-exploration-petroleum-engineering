# Data Exploration in Petroleum Engineering

This project was created as part of my career transition into the Data Engineering field.
Although my formal education is in Petroleum Engineering from Escola Politécnica at USP, my main focus now is developing skills in programming, data analysis, and visualization using various datasets as a learning context.

## About Me

I hold a degree in Petroleum Engineering from the Escola Politécnica at the University of São Paulo (USP), with experience in consultancy and dashboard development for data-driven decision-making.
I also have extensive experience in remote education and entertainment, including singing and engaging with diverse international audiences in Europe.
Currently transitioning to Data Engineering, studying Python, Power BI, and GitHub.
